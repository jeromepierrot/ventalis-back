# Read Me First
This project is part of Ventalis project (back-end microservice).
This microservice is not supposed to work alone and should be run with other micro-services
and their eco-system (Gateway, micro web-client, etc).

        For the time being, only 'mproducts' and 'msecurity' services are available.

The website (front-end) part of the project is stored in another Git repositories :
